A Clojure client library for [hypermq][1]

[1]:https://github.com/uswitch/hypermq

## Usage

```clojure
(:require [hypermq.client :as client])

; Create messages on a queue
(client/create-message "http://localhost" "myqueue" "producer1" {:msg "1"})
; true
(client/create-message "http://localhost" "myqueue" "producer1" {:msg "2"})
; true

; Consume messages from a queue
(client/fetch-messages "http://localhost" "myqueue")
; [{:id "f83d9e11-58ed-446e-bc78-461f60b6189f" :created 1398728082 :producer "producer1" :body {:msg "1"}} 
;  {:id "40d9141d-7d5e-445c-b9ce-4be2e7d93da3" :created 1398729082 :producer "producer1" :body {:msg "2"}}]

; Optionally provide uuid of last seen message as etag to fetch only more recent messages 
(client/fetch-messages "http://localhost" "myqueue" :etag "f83d9e11-58ed-446e-bc78-461f60b6189f") 
; [{:id "40d9141d-7d5e-445c-b9ce-4be2e7d93da3" :created 1398729082 :producer "producer1" :body {:msg "2"}}]

; Acknowledge message as seen by it's id
; This simply stores the id for the client. It does not effect call to `fetch-messages` in any way. 
(acknowledge "http://localhost" "myqueue" "client1" "f83d9e11-58ed-446e-bc78-461f60b6189f")
; true

; Fetch the last seen message uuid for a client & queue
(last-seen-message "http://localhost" "myqueue" "myclient1")
; "f83d9e11-58ed-446e-bc78-461f60b6189f"
